3. Statistical graphics: Supports regression plots, heatmaps, and more.

Common Plots
1. Scatter plots: Show relationships between variables.
2. Bar plots: Compare categorical data.
3. Box plots: Show distributions of data.
4. Heatmaps: Visualize matrix data.

Example Code

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the tips dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)

# Show the plot
plt.show()


Benefits
1. Improved visualizations: Create attractive and informative plots.
2. Simplified code: High-level interface reduces the amount of code needed.
3. Statistical insights: Visualize complex data to gain insights.

Applications
1. Data analysis: Visualize data to understand distributions and relationships.
2. Research: Create informative plots to communicate research findings.
3. Business intelligence: Create reports and dashboards to inform business decisions.
