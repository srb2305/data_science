Calculating Standard Deviation

Overview
Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Formula
The standard deviation is calculated using the following formula:


std = sqrt(sum((x - mean)^2) / (n - 1))


Where:

- x is each individual value
- mean is the mean of the values
- n is the number of values

Example Code

import numpy as np

# Create a sample dataset
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate the standard deviation using NumPy
std = np.std(data)

print("Standard Deviation:", std)


This code calculates the standard deviation of a sample dataset using the np.std() function from the NumPy library.

Pandas Example

import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'Values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the standard deviation using Pandas
std = df['Values'].std()

print("Standard Deviation:", std)


This code calculates the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame using the std() method.
